### 1. Initialize Git Repository
```bash
cd /home/kamya-samuel/Projects/eskai
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: ESKAI AGI Framework v0.1.0"
```

### 2. Create GitHub Repository
```bash
# Create a new repo on GitHub, then:
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/eskai.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Set Up Environment
```bash
# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your API keys:
# OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
# GROQ_API_KEY=your_key_here  
# GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

### 4. Install and Test
```bash
# Install in development mode
pip install -e .

# Run tests
pytest

# Try the CLI
eskai --help
eskai "Hello, how are you?"
```
